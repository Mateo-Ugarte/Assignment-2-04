    <p style="color:orange;font-size:15px">On Tuesday we saw 10 out of the 12 teams in the European SuperLegue leave. The teams that left are Manchester City, Chelsea, Barclona, Inter Milan, A.C. Milan, Manchester United, Athletico Madrid, Liverpool, Tottenham, and Arsenal. The two teams left in the Superleague are Real Madrid and Juventus. The news that they were leaving came out a lof of backlash from fans, players, and managers. The project only lasted 48 hours before the teams started to pull out of the SuperLeague. This is great news as this was going to ruin the beautiful game.
